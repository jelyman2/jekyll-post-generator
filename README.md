# Jekyll Blog Post Generator
Quickly build out `.md` files inside _posts for your Jekyll blogs.

## Introduction

I wrote this tool because I found it to be too time consuming to keep a blank `.md` template somwhere, open it, then 
save it in the proper location. With this tool, all a user needs to do is answer the prompts and they're good to go.

## Requirements

This app requires Ruby and Atom. The text editor of choice can be changed. 

## Usage

Run `ruby post_generator.rb` and fill in the info as prompted. A `.md` file will be generated and Atom will open 
directly to it.

## TODO

- skip Atom if not available.
- multiple tags in template
- redirect url in template
